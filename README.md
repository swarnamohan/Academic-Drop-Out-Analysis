# Academic-Drop-Out-Analysis // Python, Excel, Tableau, PPT

The dataset contains information on students and their marital status, application details, previous academic qualifications, socioeconomic status, admission grades, and academic performance. The target variable indicates whether a student dropped out or achieved academic success. Using this dataset, a predictive model will be developed tailored to forecast dropout rates among incoming students, in order to facilitate support to those who may be at risk. The data also incorporates economic metrics such as unemployment rate, inflation, and GDP. This model will contribute to the understanding of these factors influencing educational outcomes.

Objectives

  1. Comprehensive Exploratory Analysis of Influencing Factors
  
  2. Create predictive classification model for predicting student dropout and academic success

  3. Create a predictive classifcation model that can be used on incoming students
